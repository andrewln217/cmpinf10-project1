# Name and integer combiner
This program prompts the user to enter their name(string) and their age(int) and it will print out telling the user their name and age. 

## How to Use
To install Name and Integer Combiner, create a clone of the Name-and-Integer-Combiner repository from using https://github.com/[USERNAME]/name-and-integer-combiner.git. 

The current directory should be name-and-integer-combiner. Run “Something-Program” by using the python command ```python Something-Program```. If successful, you should be prompted to ```Enter a name: ``` at which point, you can enter any string. Then you will be prompted to ```Enter your age in years: ``` at which point, you can enter any integer. 

If you enter something other than an integer, the program will print out ```Enter an integer as your age```, at which point, you must run “Something-Program” again. 

If you successfully enter values for your name and age, the program will print ```You are [name] and you are [age] years old.
