For our LICENSE, we chose to use the Unlicense template because the program is very simple, and as such, it does not merit a copyright. Such simple programs should be available to the public's use without restriction. For our CODE_OF_CONDUCT, we chose the Contributor Covenant template because it enforces values that we believe should be maintained by all people working on the project, and we believe that should this code of conduct be followed, contributions to the program will be at their most productive and beneficial.
